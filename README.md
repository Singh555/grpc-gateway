## gRPC Server in Go

This Go program implements a simple gRPC server using the google.golang.org/grpc library. The server exposes a SayHello method, allowing clients to send a greeting.
How it Works

    The server struct is defined, implementing the helloworldpb.UnimplementedGreeterServer interface.
    The SayHello method processes incoming requests and responds with a greeting.
    The NewServer function creates an instance of the server.
    The main function sets up a TCP listener on port :9090.
    An instance of the gRPC server is created using grpc.NewServer().
    The SayHello method is registered with the gRPC server.
    The server starts listening on the specified port, printing a message when it's ready.

How to Run

To run the server, execute the following steps:

```bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository

# Install dependencies
go get -u google.golang.org/grpc

# Run the code
go run main.go
```
Ensure that you have Go installed on your machine.
Access the gRPC Server

The gRPC server is accessible at localhost:9090. It exposes the SayHello method, which you can use to send greetings.
Dependencies

The code relies on the following external dependencies:
